                    <p class="p-text">Color blindness, or the inability to distinguish certain colors, presents a fascinating
                        challenge in the world of user experience. As we explore this condition, we aim to uncover
                        the intricacies of how color blindness affects individuals' perception of digital content.
                        By understanding these challenges, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and
                        user-friendly online environment for everyone, regardless of their color vision abilities.

                            <p>Deuteranopia is the most common type of color blindness, affecting about 6% of men. It is characterized by a reduced sensitivity to green light, making it difficult to differentiate between shades of red and green. Common symptom is that green traffic signals appear to be a very pale green or sometimes white.</p>

                            <p>Protanomaly is the second most common and is characterized by a reduced sensitivity to red light. People with protanomaly have difficulty distinguishing between shades of red and green. A person with protan type color blindness tends to see greens, yellows, oranges, reds, and browns as being more similar shades of color than normal, especially in low light. It is estimated that about 25% of cases of red-green color blindness are of the protan type.

                            <p>Tritanomaly is a rare type of color blindness that affects both males and females equally. It is characterized by a reduced sensitivity to blue light, making it difficult to differentiate between shades of blue and green, as well as yellow and red. Tritan color blindness most commonly acquired later in life due to aging of the eye or a medical condition such as glaucoma and is only very rarely inherited from birth.

                            <p>Sometimes these are collectively referred to as types of achromatopsia, as the word “achromat” meaning “no color.” However, not all cases of achromatopsia have “no color” vision. Achromatopsia is often associated with light sensitivity, photophobia, and glare sensitivity. In some cases, low vision disorders such as progressive cone dystrophy or retinitis pigmentosa can cause a gradual deterioration of color vision that eventually turns into complete achromatopsia.
